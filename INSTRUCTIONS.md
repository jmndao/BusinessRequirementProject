This document provides instructions for collaborating on the business requirements project using Git and GitHub. Please follow these guidelines to ensure smooth teamwork and effective version control.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Each team member should fork the main project repository to their own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git
     ```

3. **Set Up the Main Repository as Upstream:**
   - To keep your forked repository up-to-date with the main repository, set the main repository as an upstream source:
     ```
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/main-username/project-repo.git
     ```

## Collaboration Workflow
