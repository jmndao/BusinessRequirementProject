Getting started with app development can reveal an impressive number of development options. But with the right app development process, it's much easier. Our development process will involve agile methodology.

Agile methodologies allow teams to work on project phases simultaneously and within short deadlines. Additionally, being agile gives you the flexibility to change direction at short notice or experiment with new approaches.Finally, agile methodologies encourages early ROI through iterative and collaborative project management.

Here are the steps we will go through :

## Pre-launch :

The pre-launch phase aims to identify the main concept and purpose of the application. It is important to get this step right because it determines the success of the project. It starts with a clear vision of the application and its functionalities. Teams must do a lot of research and design preparation at this crucial stage.

Developers should also review the UI/UX during this time, with the ideal outcome being the production of a prototype. Designing a prototype that provides excellent user experience should be the top priority in app development. But a prototype can also make the application more efficient by maximizing its acceptance and use. Both data suggest that user testing (UT) should be a key part of the pre-launch stage to ensure success.

## Frontend Development:

The second phase of the app development stages is frontend development. This differs from UI/UX in the way front-end developers work on an app's functionality. Transforming UX or UI designs into code is the main goal here. Developers therefore need to ensure that interface elements lead users to the intended locations and that data is stored for processing.

During the front-end development phase, developers review all designs, architectures and interfaces, including payment gateways. They can also speed up development with reusable codes. In this step it will also be necessary to decide which of the following elements could be most appropriate to the needs:

-Native: Is the process of building apps for a specific operating system like Android and iOS. Each OS has a specific design language, integrated development environment, and guidelines.

-Hybrid or Cross-Platform Functionality: Hybrid app development involves using web languages such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to code applications that are then run in a native shell with an integrated web browser. By taking this approach, developers can share backend code, allowing them to build apps quickly and affordably for multiple platforms.This is often favored by startups who prefer the reduction in time and cost.

When choosing the right type of app development approach, developers will consider many aspects of the prototype or pre-launch phase. These may include degrees of personalization, security or authentication, social media integration, application speed, customer service support and responsiveness levels.

## Backend Development:

This is the opposite side of frontend app development. This is where the final stage of application development takes place. Its role is to support the creation of system architecture, databases, servers, application programming interfaces (APIs), security, and several other background processes. To do this, it defines the fundamental code that allows the application to process actions from the frontend.

Additionally, security and functionality are two areas that developers will focus on during this phase. And since iteration is an important part of the development process, it's important to note the differences between the first version and the final version. If application priorities change, developers working with Agile methodologies can benefit from exchanging features during each development iteration.

## Post-Launch :

The post-launch phase serves as a bookend to all stages of application development. It is a critical and sometimes overlooked aspect of the application development process, defined by supporting, monitoring and maintaining the application to ensure its relevance and proper functioning. Additionally, application security is essential and requires attention from application developers to support the discovery of bugs and code errors before release.

Mobile app users are likely to lose interest or disengage if they have trouble navigating an app. Thus, performing quality assurance testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and test-driven development (TDD) is vital at this stage of the application development process.

Once testing is complete, deployment can begin.
