In light of the current challenges posed by price inflation, many individuals are encountering difficulties in preserving their finances for future endeavors. The burden of financial responsibilities often impedes their ability to save, and even when they do succeed, unforeseen expenditures invariably arise. Whether these expenditures are essential or discretionary, the mere presence of readily accessible funds in their accounts or wallets makes it increasingly tempting to utilize them, thereby creating obstacles to savings.

To address this issue, we are committed to offering an application designed to assist individuals in managing their financial reserves on a monthly or ad-hoc basis. This application will facilitate the creation of a separate savings account, directly linked to their primary account, where users can securely deposit their savings at their discretion. Moreover, our application will offer the convenience of automated savings, allowing users to designate a predetermined amount to be systematically transferred from their primary account to their savings account each month.

The envisioned application will incorporate distinct categories, enabling users to differentiate and allocate their savings for specific purposes. This segmentation will empower users to distinguish their emergency fund from funds designated for, say, home construction or other particular financial goals. In doing so, they can precisely track and manage their financial objectives with greater ease and clarity.

Furthermore, our application will feature a comprehensive tracking mechanism, presenting users with graphical representations, such as charts, to provide a visual and insightful overview of their savings frequency and progress. This visual representation will not only enhance transparency but also offer a clear and motivating insight into their savings journey.
